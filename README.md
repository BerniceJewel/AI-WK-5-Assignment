Patient Readmission Prediction  AI Workflow Assignment

This project applies the AI Development Workflow to a real-world healthcare scenario: predicting whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge. It demonstrates each stage of the pipeline  from problem definition to model deployment and evaluation.
 Objectives

    Predict high-risk readmissions using Electronic Health Records (EHRs)

    Reduce hospital readmission rates

    Improve patient outcomes and resource allocation


 Tech Stack

    Python 3

    Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

    Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸ“ˆ Key Features

    Synthetic healthcare dataset generation

    Preprocessing pipeline (handling missing data, normalization, encoding)

    Logistic Regression with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

    Evaluation using F1-Score AUC ROC and confusion matrix

    Ethical considerations (bias privacy interpretability)
